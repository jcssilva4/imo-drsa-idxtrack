How to use the vcdomlem from the jRS lib trough python?

You need to setup a local Gateway server to run the vcdomlem in a JVM through py4j.

How to setup the Gateway server?

1. Create a new java project
   1.1 create the VCdomlemEntryPoint.java in the src folder
   1.2 right-click project -> properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries
   1.3 JavaSE - 1.8 (this is the JRE version in which jRS works)
   1.4 Try to run and check if Eclipse tries to build the application correctly (of course there will be errors, because the dependencies were not resolved)
2. Set the plugins
   2.1 All the plugins you need are in the vcdomlem/plugins folder
   2.2 Right-click proj -> build path -> configure build path -> add External Jars
   2.3 Select all the plugins in the vcdomlem/plugins folder
3. Finally, add the py4j plugin
   3.1 this plugin is available in the python lib folder (Python\Python37\share\py4j)
   3.2 Copy the py4jcurrentVersion.jar to the vcdomlem/plugins folder 
   3.3 Add py4j.jar to the build path
